              <p>
                I'm a passionate software engineer who loves building scalable systems and 
                turning thoughtful ideas into impactful digital experiences.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                I've worked on meaningful engineering challenges, including helping localize 
                over 70% of TurboTax's web pages into Spanish during my time at Intuitâ€”making 
                the product more accessible to millions of Spanish-speaking users in the U.S. 
                My focus lies in backend development, and I enjoy learning new technologies to 
                solve complex, real-world problems.
              </p>
              
              <p>
                When I'm not coding, you can find me playing volleyball or table tennis with 
                friends, or binge-watching great TV shows. I thrive in collaborative teams, and 
                I'm always looking for opportunities to grow, contribute, and connect with others
                in the developer community.
